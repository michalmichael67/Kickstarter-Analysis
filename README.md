# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
In this project, data analysis was done on kickstarter campaigns in order to uncover trends. There was categorical analysis, time analysis, and distribution analysis done.
## Categorical Analysis
* An analysis of the Theater category was done - there was a total of 912 campains with 57.57% successful, 38.27% failed, 2.85% canceled and 1.31% currently live. 
* Within Theater, an analysis of Plays was done - there was a total of 671 campains with 61.40% successful, 37.26% failed, 1.34 live and no campaigns canceled. 
## Time Analysis
* By month, May was the most successful month to launch a theater campaign. 
## Distribution Analysis
* Across, Theater, Makerspaces, and Musical campaigns there was a clear difference between the successful and failed campaigns. The successful campains had a mean goal of 5,000 - 7,000 while the failed campaigns had a goal of 10,000-27,000. This seems to suggest that the campaigns with lower goals were utimately more successful. 
* Across all 3 sectors, the standard deviations between the goals was smaller. This would suggest that the successful campaigns knew that their target goal would be more successful within a certain range rather than the failed campaigns which seemed to set a goal regardless of that research.
